1. Copy the audit_pro folder and its files into:

./system/expressionengine/third_party

2. Navigate to Add-ons -> Extensions in the Control Panel

3. Click Enable for Audit Pro. When prompted, Install both the Extension & Module.

(It's possible to run the Extension only, which would log data to the database without providing a screen in the Control Panel.)
